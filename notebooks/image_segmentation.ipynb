    "# Image Segmentation of Spiral Galaxies\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed insight into the process that goes into the segmentation of spiral arms from images of spiral galaxies. This notebook accompanies the final year research project I completed for my Masters Degree in Professional Engineering (Software) at University of WA. The dataset used for this notebook is adapted from images retrieved from the 2nd public data release from the HSC data archive system, which is operated by Subaru Telescope and Astronomy Data Center at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and classification of spiral galaxies from this dataset was achieved by [Tadaki et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13544.pdf) and all image content is a product of their work. You can register to access the HSC Data [here](https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/data-access__pdr3/)."
