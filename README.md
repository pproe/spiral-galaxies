# Classification and Segmentation of Spiral Galaxies using Keras

This repository hosts all relevant python scripts and notebooks used in my final-year application of the U-Net Image Segmentation model to images of spiral galaxies. This work was completed as part of my final-year research project to achieve my Masters Degree in Professional Engineering (Software). 

> **Update (8/03/23)** - At this stage of the project I am reaching the final stretch of the research, transitioning my focus to collating my results and writing the accompanying paper. The model has performed promisingly on prelimnary data-sets at this stage, and I will be tweaking hyperparameters and data augmentation techniques. I intend to add more to this README as the project matures, along with a IPython notebook to make the project more usable.
